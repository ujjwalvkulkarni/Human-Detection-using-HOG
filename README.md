# Human-Detection-using-HOG

<br />



<pre>
Instructions to run the program:<br />
  1. Download OpenCV for python, which can be directly added on Anaconda Navigator or
     by executing the following command in the terminal: pip install opencv-python.<br />
     (Note: OpenCV package is just used to read and write images in the source code)
  2. The other packages that must be installed are Math, Numpy and Os, Glob.<br />
  3. Open the source code files in a code editor which supports python. They are HOG.py,
     KNN.py, GradMag.py and ascii.py.<br />


To run the detection on test image:<br />
  4. Open HOG.py and compile (All the .py files must be inside the same folder).<br />
  5. In the KNN.py file, paste the path for positive and negative training images on line 20
     and 21 respectively.<br />
  6. Similarly, paste the test image location path on line 16 and 17.<br />
  7. Run the Program to check the detection results in the output terminal.<br />


To check the gradient magnitude images:<br />
  8. Open GradMag.py and paste the image path for positive and negative test dataset on line
     14 and 15 respectively.<br />
  9. Run the program.<br />
  10. The Gradient Images will be stored in the folder containing the positive and negative test
      images.
<br />

To get the HOG Vectors in .txt files:<br />
  11. Open the ascii.py file, paste the path for positive and negative training images on line 16
      and 17 respectively.<br />
  12. Similarly, paste the test image location path on line 12 and 13.
  13. Run the program.<br />
  14. The .txt files will be saved in the folder containing all the python scripts.
